 Bruschetta-Board has been designed by [Luca Bongiorni](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucabongiorni) and made available by the awesome guys from https://www.aprbrother.com/ for any hardware hacker out there that is looking for a fairly-priced all-in-one debugger & programmer that supports: UART, JTAG, I2C & SPI protocols and allows to interact with different targets' voltages (i.e., 1.8, 2.5, 3.3 and 5 Volts!).<br>

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT REMINDER** ‚ö†Ô∏è<br>
If you plan to use the BRUSCHETTA-Board as UART and/or JTAG debugger REMEMBER to first unplug any I2C and SPI device that may keep busy the data lines!!!
Otherwise it will create communication issues!!!<br>

## Operating Modes<br>
BRUSCHETTA-board has 4 Operating Modes, however the ones that you will need most are Mode 2 (UART1+I2C+SPI-VCP) and Mode 4 (UART1+JTAG).
**To switch between them you have to set use the DPI-switch S1 & S2:<br>**

**- Mode 2 (UART1+I2C+SPI-VCP): S1=ON and S2=OFF<br>**
    Before starting using your BRUSCHETTA-Board as SPI or I2C Programmer... you will have to change the mode:
    
          ‚Ä¢ Switch it to Mode-2 by setting the DIP switch S1 to ON and the S2 to OFF (see image below);
          
          ‚Ä¢ Set the target voltage level (which in the case below was 3.3V);
          
          ‚Ä¢ Set the Jumper of the Chip Select to CS0.

**- Mode 4 (UART1+JTAG): S1=ON and S2=ON<br>**
    To use it as UART and JTAG debugger (both working at the same time) you will have to set both S1 & S2 to ON.

## Level Shifters<br>
A nice feature of BRUSCHETTA-board that makes it perfect for Hardware Hackers is the fact it mounts Level Shifters.<br>
No matter if you have to use it for UART, JTAG, SPI or I2C... if you target is working at 1.8V, 2.5V, 3.3V or 5V... BRUSCHETTA-board is here to help you! You just need to move the Level Shifter Jumper to the target's voltage BEFORE connecting it to the device and the PC.<br>

## Windows<br>
**Drivers Installation**<br>
Before plugging the BRUSCHETTA-board on a Windows OS do install the driver CH341PAR.EXE<br>

**JTAG & SWD - OpenOCD**<br>

This is the official repo from the IC manufacturer, however I do recommend to use the openocd repo within mine Github repository since it was succesfully compiled and tested with BRUSCHETTA-board <br>
https://github.com/WCHSoftGroup/ch347<br>

```cd ~/Desktop```<br>
```git clone https://github.com/whid-injector/BRUSCHETTA-Board```<br>
```cd BRUSCHETTA-Board/Linux/openocd-bruschetta```<br>
```./bootstrap```<br>
```./configure --prefix=/home/<YOUR-USER>/Desktop/BRUSCHETTA-Board/openocd-ch347 --disable-doxygen-html --disable-doxygen-pdf --disable-gccwarnings --disable-wextra --enable-ch347```<br>
```make -j 4```<br>
```sudo make install```<br>

Now copy bruschetta-openocd.cfg in ```/home/<YOUR-USER>/Desktop/BRUSCHETTA-Board/openocd-ch347/bin```<br>

```sudo ./openocd -f bruschetta-openocd.cfg -f TARGET.cfg```<br><br>

## Tips & Tricks
In case you plan to use BRUSCHETTA-Board on a VM I do recommend to enable the USB3.0 controller.<br><br>

## 3D Printed Case
In this repo you can find the STL CAD file to print your own case for BRUSCHETTA-board. <br>
Ifyou do not own a 3D printer... there are plenty of cheap services out there. <br>
If you live in EU, I do love the guys from [Craftrum](https://www.craftrum.eu), they already printed ton of cases for me ü•á<br>
